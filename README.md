# tSync - best workflow experience on multiple devices
This application is basic implementation of my idea to synchronize all devices and their workspaces. This will be improved in the future.

# Working
- connection with many devices
- responsive virtual mouse movement

# Not working/ Not implemented yet
- virtual mouse buttons
- virtual keyboard
- virtual copy of window (for wayland: client wl_surface -> server wl_surface) //simplfied
- wayland compositor :/ - (I lost my mind after reading 0.01% wlroots source code)
